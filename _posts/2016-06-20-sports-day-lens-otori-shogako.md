For the second year I volunteered to help set up with the PTA, putting posters up in the morning, then afterwards returning the playground ready for Monday morning school.

Starting at 7am, there, as previous years, already a queue of waiting parents eager to get the best spots, and even with myself helping I still had to join the others parents to grab a place at 8am. 

The event runs for about 6 hours with the whole school split into 3 teams. Len was Yellow - Thunder, and followed the set chants, dances and cheering that is expected.

All students get at least 2 races / competitions with parents joining in at one point. the finally is with the year 6 fighting for hats as they sit on their team mates shoulders. this gets very violent.

The students themselves run the day giving out prizes, comparing, even starting races with the starters gun. A few governments from around the world could learn from these sports events. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/2ba84ac6-99ac-4400-8fd7-6ee1653a5227.jpg)

With a big dance that included everyone at the end the awards were given out and tears and emotions from the losing teams, filled the field. 

Len's team as of the previous year won.
