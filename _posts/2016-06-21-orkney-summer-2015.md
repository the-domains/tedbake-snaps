# Orkney Summer 2015
![The Ring of Brodgar Orkney](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/e52df9e6-f049-415d-8eb4-8ea063e47f05.jpg)

My trip started with a drive from Nottingham to Holy Island with Dad & Mum in their Camper Van. Stopping off for lunch along Hadrian's Wall North of Northumbria before setting up at [Old Mill Caravan Site][0] just over the water from Holy Island.

We stayed two nights here one day spent on the island and the other going south to sea houses and the beautiful castle at Bamburgh.

We then travelled north into Scotland and stayed at south west coast of Edinburgh where we stayed at a old favourite camping site of [Drummohr][1]

This site is a bus journey into the city centre that leaves from the bottom of the road where the camping site is.

After two days we drove to Aberdeen to pick Mariko & Len up from the airport and a hire car...

before continuing the drive along the coast to Narin where we stayed the night Mariko & myself in the [Braval Hotel][2] and Mum Dad & Len stayed in the Motor Home at [Narin Motor home site ][3]. We all had a beautiful Meal at the Hotel and i enjoyed a night cap of Perfect Pint of Brew Dog chased by a wee dram pf Scarpa.

We continued the drive the following day stopping for a break at Tain before continuing to John O' Groats to catch the ferry across to Orkney

From a vary windy point to the British Isles we took the short ferry journey across to St Margarets Hope traversing the islands and into Scarpa Flow.From the ferry we drove to [Pickaquoy Centre][4] where we pitched the tent and set up for the next few days.

Whist on the island we explored many islands including Rousay and Hoy and North and South of the Mainland

This is a place i have wanted to come to for may years and it did not disappoint, its cold in the middle of summer, very windy most days but being of the beaten track we were able to see and experience some of the worlds oldest civilisations alone...Loads of walking, fresh air and one of the most photogenic places i have travelled to.

A few amazing places we saw;

* Ring of Brodgar
* Standing Stones of Stenness
* Old Man of Hoy
* Tomb of the Eagles
* Brock of Gurness
* Brough of Birsay

Sadly we did have to leave eventually and traveled back to the mainland stopping at [Loch Ness][5] for a night with an evening in Aviemore, before continuing back to Edinburgh and back to [Drummer][1] taking in the amazingly scenic cairngorms on the way.
