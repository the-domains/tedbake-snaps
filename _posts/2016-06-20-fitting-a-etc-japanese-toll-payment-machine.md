Its not impossible to save the 3000yen and fit this yourself, but as many things in Japan its also not straight forward.

You can pay upwards of 8000yen to get this bought and fitted by a shop, I went for the cheaper 5000yen and bought this through R[akuten.][0]

You need to upload your vehicle registration to the site and then they register this with ETC before shipping tis to you to fit. 

I used this youtube to [help][1]

The crucial part is having to buy extensions to enable this to plug into your circuit box, i also had to buy more fuses as the ones i used were old and too small.
